# zhttp

zhttp is a library for dealing with HTTP messages.


## Installation

zhttp will build on any Unix based platform with whatever compiler you choose.  If just dropping into a program of your own, you will need the <a href="https://github.com/zaiah-dj/zwalker">zwalker</a> library.

zhttp can be built with:
	`gcc -Wall -Werror -std=c99 zhttp.c relative/path/to/zwalker.c main.c`


## Usage

<!-- Provided you are familiar with Unix sockets, using zhttp shouldn't be terribly difficult. -->



## Notes

zhttp is in alpha state and is under HEAVY development at the moment.
