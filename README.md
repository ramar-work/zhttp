# zhttp

zhttp is a library for walking through blocks of memory.  It was built as a less buggy / more useful replacement for strstr and friends.  It is composed of two files and can be dropped into your project with little issue. 


## Installation

To keep things simple, this will probably never be packaged officially.  zhttp will build on any Unix based platform with whatever compiler you choose.

zhttp can be built with:
	`gcc -Wall -Werror -std=c99 zhttp.c main.c`


## Usage

hi


## Notes

zhttp was extracted from a much larger library of mine called <a href="https://github.com/zaiah-dj/single">single.c</a>.  Much of that library has no use now, but this is one of the pieces that has found its way into my recent projects.
